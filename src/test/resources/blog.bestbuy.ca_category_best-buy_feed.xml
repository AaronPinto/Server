<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Buffer Festival is back bigger and better this year in partnership with FAN EXPO Canada after a three-year gap. At Best Buy we&#8217;re getting ready together with Toronto to celebrate the work of acclaimed <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/collection/content-creator/408457" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>digital creators</strong></a> and to support aspiring video creators at our Creator Zone at FAN EXPO. Read on to learn how you can join the festivities and enter for a chance to win great prizes at the festival. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Get inspired to share your stories at Buffer Festival and FAN EXPO </span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Buffer Festival is the largest international digital-first film festival that rewards today&#8217;s acclaimed digital creators. From August 26th to August 28th, participants will be able to enjoy theatrical screenings of curated video premieres and inspiring keynotes. Best Buy will be there for the occasion by sponsoring and presenting an award at the Buffer Festival Gala. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This year, the festivities don&#8217;t end at the doors of the John W. H. Bassett theatre. Buffer Festival partnered with FAN EXPO Canada to offer digital content enthusiasts an even better experience. FAN EXPO Canada is one of the largest fan events in North America, and from August 25th to August 28th, Buffer Festival will occupy 10,000 square feet at the event where creator talks, live performances, podcasts, and other special events and experiential activities will take place. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Meet creators and test the latest video gear at the Best Buy Creator Zone</strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Best Buy will have a creator zone within Buffer Festival&#8217;s area at FAN EXPO, where you&#8217;ll be able to meet established creators and try the latest and greatest equipment for content creation to produce your own video from start to finish. Whether you&#8217;re an aspiring content creator or a seasoned video producer, you&#8217;ll be able to get hands-on with the latest cameras, gimbals, ring lights, and more, as well as ask questions to our knowledgeable Blue Shirts about the products to help you get started with your content creation journey or improve your videos.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once you&#8217;re familiar with the equipment and know how to shoot a great video with the gear, make sure to attend one of our two functional lighting and editing workshops to learn the craft of editing from industry experts. You&#8217;ll then be able to apply some of that knowledge to create and edit your own video to enter our contest for a chance to win great prizes. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How to enter the contest </span></strong></h2>
<p>Visit the Best Buy Creator Zone at the Toronto FAN EXPO between August 25th and August 28th. Use the gear provided by Best Buy and the participating vendors or your own device to create an original short video, then upload it to TikTok or Instagram with the hashtag #BestBuyatBufferFestival. Make sure your account is public so we can see your post.</p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What you can win</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We are excited to give away the tools you will need to create content and share your stories. Each winner of this contest will receive one of the tools that were used in the Creator Zone. Potential prizes include: </span></p>

<h2><strong>Which PC is right for your needs</strong></h2>
<p>At this time of year, many parents are looking for a new laptop. Perhaps this is for a child who will soon be back in school. Or you may be replacing an older machine to boost productivity and reduce the frustration that a slow, poorly performing laptop has been giving you. For many people deciding on the right laptop can be challenging: you peruse the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/category/laptops-macbooks/20352" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Best Buy Laptops page</strong> </a>and see a huge variety of processors, storage options, display types, etc. Which one is right for your family?</p>
<p>You can get some of this information from articles, like the many that we post on the Best Buy blog. However, nothing beats the chance to be face to face with an expert, learning from them and getting your questions answered. The Microsoft live events at Best Buy bring the experts to you.</p>

This provides more purchasing options for  Canadians looking for the best deals on technology and other products. It also builds on Best Buy&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/about/commitment-to-environment/blt6cddfa55b0e75186" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>many initiatives toward sustainability</strong></a> by developing greener, more eco-friendly ways to conduct business.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a refurbished product</strong></h2>
<p>Best Buy is well known for having the largest selection in Canada of factory fresh, new technology and other products in stores and online. Best Buy is also becoming your destination for refurbished products. These are products that are not brand new, but are otherwise in 100% working order and all come with a minimum 90-day warranty. All refurbished products have been fully repaired, thoroughly cleaned, and include required accessories. The refurbished products carried by Best Buy are available in three conditions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Refurbished – Excellent:</strong> Product has been tested for 100% functionality and has a few to no visible signs of wear.</li>
<li><strong>Refurbished – Good:</strong> Product has been tested for 100% functionality and has light signs of wear or micro-scratches.</li>
<li><strong>Refurbished – Fair:</strong> Product has been tested for 100% functionality and has visible signs of wear or scratches</li>
</ul>
<p>Refurbished products offer great savings. When purchasing a product from Best Buy consider the advantages of ordering a refurbished version of a product. You get a fully functioning device, inspected by a qualified 3rd party refurbisher, and save money compared to buying a factor fresh version of the same device.</p>
<h2><strong>How will I know if the product is new or refurbished</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-250561" src="http://blog.bestbuy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PDP-condition-banner.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="134" srcset="https://blog.bestbuy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PDP-condition-banner.jpg 445w, https://blog.bestbuy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PDP-condition-banner-288x124.jpg 288w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" />Best Buy online product pages will clearly identify the condition of the product. The product name at the top of the page will state if the product is refurbished. Additionally, if it is a refurbished product, a banner similar to that shown here on the right will state the condition of the refurbished product as either Excellent, Good, or Fair.</p>
<p>Many of the refurbished products that you find online at Best Buy will be available from trusted vendor-partners on the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/about/what-is-marketplace/blt0abb2e20522802f2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Best Buy Marketplace</strong></a>. These refurbished items are held to the same high standards as items identified as &#8220;Sold by Best Buy&#8221; on the product pages.</p>
<h3><strong>What if I am unhappy with the product I purchased</strong></h3>
<p>As with any product purchased from Best Buy, you can return or exchange the product within the applicable return and exchange policy for that specific item. Additionally, as stated above, all refurbished items include a minimum 90-day warranty. Visit the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/help/returns-and-exchanges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Returns and Exchanges page</strong></a> to learn more about returning products purchased from Best Buy. Best Buy makes the process easy to follow and worry-free. On that page you&#8217;ll also see specific details about <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/help/returns-and-exchanges/marketplace-returns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>returning purchases made from a Marketplace seller</strong></a>.</p>
<h2><strong>What are some other Best Buy sustainability initiatives</strong></h2>
<p>Best Buy has several programs to help customers find technology that suit their needs and also reduce the amount of electronics that end up in landfills. For example, many types of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/help/haul-away-and-recycling/battery-and-electronic-recycling-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>batteries and home electronics</strong></a> can be dropped off at your local Best Buy store. So when your old toaster stops working, you can drop it off at Best Buy to be recycled and at the same time purchase a new, energy efficient replacement (look for the Energy Star certification found on the most energy efficient appliances). Similarly, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/event/trade-in-program/blt339c714a25ebe963" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>many electronics</strong></a> qualify for Best Buy&#8217;s trade in program, allowing you to get money back as you upgrade your tech with the latest and greatest new technology.</p>
<p>Best Buy is working with many partners, including our customers, to <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/about/commitment-to-environment/blt6cddfa55b0e75186" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>create a better, more sustainable world</strong></a> for us all. Ensuring that we get the most value from the technology that enters the market is part of that vision. It&#8217;s a vision that includes many other initiatives like recycling programs. This vision also involves making available energy efficient technologies, like Energy Star certified appliances, and new products designed to have a positive impact on our lives and the environment, like the growing selection of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/category/electric-transportation/19781810" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>electric transportation vehicles</strong> </a>that reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.</p>

<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> applications are closed for Student Squad. Thank you to everyone who applied for the program or shared details to help raise awareness of the program.  Successful applicants will be contacted in August.</p>
<p>Watch for the interesting content created by Student Squad members throughout the upcoming school season. And for all of your back to school tech needs, be sure to see the many <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/collection/shop-all-deals/16074" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>great deals that Best Buy has on its website</strong></a> throughout the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{original article about Student Squad}</p>
<p>Are you a tech savvy student who loves to share their newest devices with the rest of the world? That’s the kind of person Best Buy is looking for! Technology is way more fun when you can tell people about it … especially when you get some of the latest and greatest technology for free. Intrigued? Learn more about the new Student Squad program coming to Best Buy Canada, then tell your friends and family to also check it out. We’ll soon be selecting a small group of students to be the first Student Squad for Best Buy.</p>
<h2><strong>Who can apply</strong></h2>
<p>I’m sure that one of the first questions you want answered is “Am I eligible to apply for Best Buy’s Student Squad?” The answer is yes, if you:</p>
<ol>
<li>live in Canada,</li>
<li>will be a student at a college, university, trade school, or other post-secondary school throughout the duration of the program (September 2022 to January 2023),</li>
<li>are active on social media. To be considered for this program, applicants must have an active and public TikTok and Instagram profile—YouTube is a bonus.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Student Squad program will run from September until January. During this five month period, participants will be sent technology carried by Best Buy to use and enjoy. They will be required to post video, images, and thoughts about the tech they receive on their own social channels. They will also be periodically featured on Best Buy’s social channels. And, they can earn commission on sales made on eligible products through their affiliate links. The purpose is clear: raise awareness of the latest and greatest technology available at Best Buy.</p>
<h2><strong>How will the program work</strong></h2>
<p>The program begins with the selection process. Each student who thinks they would make a great Student Squad ambassador will first click on the “Apply Now for Student Squad” link in this article to access the application form. This link will be live from June 30th until July 22nd. Complete that form as completely as you can.</p>
<p>Applications will be reviewed during the week last week of July and up to five students will be advised of their acceptance into the program early in August.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the benefits of participating</strong></h2>
<p>This is an exciting opportunity for anyone who loves tech and it comes with some amazing benefits. These benefits come in two different forms: free products and affiliate commission.</p>
<ol>
<li>Free technology: Students participating in this program will get to keep the technology that Best Buy sends to them for the purpose of this program. The tech will vary from participant to participant and may include laptops, tablets, electric transportation, smart home devices, health tech, and more.</li>
<li>Affiliate commission: Sharing links to the products that you receive on social channels will bring financial benefits to each participant. Students have the potential to earn a percentage of each eligible sale that results from someone clicking on the link in your social post. For example, you post about an electric scooter your received from Best Buy, someone clicks on the link in your post and buys a scooter, you get rewarded with a percentage of that sale. Percentages will vary depending on product category and will range between five and eight percent for most products.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see the full details about what is eligible for commission in the “Payout Details” section on the application form.</p>
<p>On top of these tangible benefits, you will be developing an online reputation for sharing quality products online and building your online profile as a paid affiliate marketer. Best Buy will also allow some of your content to be shared on its channels, boosting impressions on your channels and expanding your community of followers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/collection/rtx-30-series-graphic-cards/316108?icmp=blog_Nvidia_availability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Cards</strong></a> will soon become more easily available at Best Buy, in store and online, for Canadians. Customers will be able order online for home delivery and find some cards for purchase at select Best Buy stores. This article will detail the process to purchase one for yourself. Selection and quantities will vary both online and in stores. Also, household limits may be added for some products, depending on changes in demand and stock levels.</p>
<h2><strong>NVIDIA “Restocked and Reloaded” event for ultimate gaming performance</strong></h2>
<p>Since their launch, the GeForce RTX 30 Series has been the most sought-after PC component we have seen, resulting in stock shortages around the world. These cards received high praise for many reasons including the impressive performance they bring to demanding applications like fast paced, incredibly complex PC games, delivering higher resolutions at higher frame rates than ever before. The availability of these cards is rapidly improving, and more gamers will be able to upgrade their gaming PC with one of these amazing GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards. NVIDIA is calling this turning point: “Restocked and Reloaded” to emphasize that gamers will have a much easier time finding these graphics cards than ever before.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you obtain an Nvidia Graphics card</strong></h2>
<p>As stated above, RTX 30 Series Graphics Cards will became more available to purchase online and in store beginning immediately. Best Buy and NVIDIA are hoping to make these cards available to more Canadian gamers who are ready to upgrade their gaming performance. Selection will vary both online and in stores and will change rapidly as more stock arrives. Here are some tips to help you find the right card for your needs.<img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-247498" src="http://blog.bestbuy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/store-pickup-image.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="416" srcset="https://blog.bestbuy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/store-pickup-image.jpg 403w, https://blog.bestbuy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/store-pickup-image-111x160.jpg 111w, https://blog.bestbuy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/store-pickup-image-175x253.jpg 175w, https://blog.bestbuy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/store-pickup-image-291x420.jpg 291w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/collection/rtx-30-series-graphic-cards/316108?icmp=blog_Nvidia_availability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Find the graphics card online at Best Buy</strong></a> that you would like to purchase, then check to see if any stock is still available.</li>
<li>Place your order online for free home delivery.</li>
<li>You will see on the right hand side of the product page an image like this one with store availability near you. If the product is available in a nearby store you may be able to pick it up from that store instead of having it shipped to you. Importantly, store availability can change quickly.</li>
</ol>

<p>With rising gas prices, many people are turning to <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/category/electric-transportation/19781810" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>electric transportation</strong></a>. There&#8217;s a huge demand for electric bikes, electric scooters, and hoverboards. I attended a Best Buy in-store experience to test out new products from Segway. This gives people an opportunity to test an electric rideable, right in the store.</p>
<p>In this blog, I’ll discuss the different Segway products I saw, and my experience trying them out in the store. If you&#8217;re interested in electric transportation, this should help you understand the different options available for kids and adults. Finally, I’ll end by discussing the coolest electric rideable I’ve ever seen, an electric go-kart.</p>
<h2><b>Segway Ninebot Max</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/segway-ninebot-kickscooter-g30p-max-electric-scooter-65km-range-30km-h-top-speed-dark-grey/14361142" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ninebot Max</strong></a> is Segway&#8217;s top-of-the-line kick scooter. I had the opportunity to <strong><a href="https://blog.bestbuy.ca/toys/bikes-scooters/segway-ninebot-max-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a></strong> it last Summer. In my opinion, it’s the Cadillac of kick scooters. With a top speed of 30 km/h and a range of 65 km, this is designed to go long distances. This makes it a good choice for people looking for commuter rideable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has a large slip-proof rubberized platform to stand on. There is plenty of room for your feet, which is important during a long ride. You can easily switch up your position, even during use. Also, the large 10-inch pneumatic tires absorb shock from bumpy roads. In all, it provides a smooth, comfortable ride. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Based on my personal experience, this is a good choice for people who need to travel larger distances. It could very well replace a commuter vehicle for work or school. At 41 lbs, it is on the heavier side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My advice is to figure out a plan for locking and storing it when you’re out and about. It&#8217;s easy to fold down and small enough to fit in the back of a car trunk. But it’s definitely something you don’t want to be carrying around for a long period of time. I speak from experience.  </span></p>

<h2><b>Segway Ninebot S Black</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of people are familiar with hoverboards. I’ve tried many but nothing like the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/segway-ninebot-s-smart-self-balancing-transporter-black/13460106" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Segway Ninebot S</strong></a>. This is a smart self balancing transporter. It features a knee-control bar in the middle. This allows riders to change the direction using their knees. I tried this for the first time in the store. It does take some time to get used to. I did get the hang of it after a couple of minutes. By adjusting my weight, I could go forward and backward. Using my knees, I could turn left and right.  The top of the knee-control bar has a handle so you can carry it when not in use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While it may look like a toy, it’s definitely not. The Ninebot S features large 10.5” pneumatic tires. This means riders can travel on all different types of terrain. It has a max speed of 16km per hour and a distance of 22km. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I think this will appeal to young, tech-savvy men. Once you get the hang of it, this is a fun and different way to travel. Still, I don&#8217;t think this would be good as a commuter vehicle alternative. It&#8217;s more geared for recreational fun.  </span></p>

<h2><b>Ninebot F40</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Ninebot F40 looks like the little brother to the Ninebot Max. It incorporates a lot of the same design elements but comes at a mid-range price point. It has a max speed of 30 km/h and a top range of 40 km. This makes it a good choice for people who don’t need the longer range of the Ninebot Max. You still get 10-inch pneumatic tires, electronic brake and disc brakes, and a quick folding system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My one recommendation is to purchase the optional Segway smartphone holder. Kick scooters require two-hand use so it’s better to have it docked upfront. That way you can monitor your text messages and listen to music with wireless earbuds. </span></p>
<h2><b>Ninebot Zing C8 </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It goes without saying that kids love electric kick scooters. Parents looking for a safe, reliable option should definitely consider the Ninebot Zing C8. It features an ergonomic design for kids ranging from 6 to 12 years old. The handbrake has a smaller gripping distance making it easier to brake. It also features a curved body with no angles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has a max speed of 16 km/h and a max range of 10km. The Ninebot Zing C8 comes with three riding modes: Safe Mode, Turbo Mode, and Cruise Mode. Kids will enjoy riding it and parents will appreciate all the safety features. </span></p>

<h2><b>Segway Ninebot Gokart PRO</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a kid, I used to beg my dad to build me a go-kart. That’s all I ever wanted and the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/segway-ninebot-go-kart-kit-bundle/15758666" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Segway Ninebot Gokart Pro</strong></a> is exactly what I envisioned it would look like. I guess you could say it’s my childhood dream, just 30 years too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s designed with an adjustable frame and steering wheel to fit riders between 4’5” to 6’3” and carry up to 200lbs. This makes it suitable for kids and adults. At 5’9”, it was super comfortable for me to sit in. The overall racecar design is absolutely amazing. It’s by far the coolest rideable I’ve seen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Ninebot Gokart PRO has a max speed of 37 km/h. That means you cannot use it on the street or in bike lanes. The max speed limit for electric bikes and scooters is 30 km/h. Basically, this is designed for dedicated racing tracks. It even comes with a Bluetooth speaker that mimics a racing engine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat in it, but I wasn’t able to drive it in-store. Hopefully, in the future, I&#8217;ll get a chance to review it. It is by far, the coolest rideable I&#8217;ve ever seen. This would be so fun to test out on a track.    </span></p>

<h2><b>The future of transportation is electric</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m glad I attended the Segway in-store experience at Best Buy. A lot of people, myself included,  are considering electric transportation. There are a lot of options to choose from, so people need to be educated on the pros and cons of each. These kinds of in-store experiences give people a chance to see them up close. This will help them figure out which one is right for their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Segway has done a fantastic job of creating products that are safe, reliable, and fun. Seeing their product line-up in-store gives people an opportunity to test them out. I love that there are dedicated kid and adult options available. That means everyone in the family can have a rideable. </span></p>
