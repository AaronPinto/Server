]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello Windows Insiders, today we are releasing <strong>Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 25188 </strong>to the Dev Channel.
<h2><strong>TL;DR</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>We are trying out a new touch keyboard setting in this build and Windows Terminal is now the default terminal.</li>
 	<li>This build includes a good set of fixes to improve the overall experience for Windows Insiders.</li>
 	<li>We’re also releasing another Microsoft Store update starting with Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel – details below.</li>
 	<li>We have added a new known issue for this build where apps that rely on the .NET Framework 3.5 may be broken. If you have apps installed that use the .NET Framework 3.5 and need them to work, you may want to pause flighting and hold off updating to this build.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What’s new</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Updated Touch Keyboard Settings</strong></h3>
We are trying out a new touch keyboard setting that replaces the “Show the touch keyboard when there’s no keyboard attached” checkbox under <strong>Settings &gt; Time &amp; language &gt; Typing &gt; Touch keyboard</strong> with a new dropdown menu with 3 options to control whether tapping an edit control should launch the touch keyboard:
<ul>
 	<li>"Never" suppresses the touch keyboard even when no hardware keyboard is attached.</li>
 	<li>"When no keyboard attached" will show the touch keyboard only when the device is used as a tablet without the hardware keyboard.</li>
 	<li>"Always" will show the touch keyboard even when the hardware keyboard is attached.</li>
</ul>
[caption id="attachment_175823" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2022/08/touch-keyboard-new-settings.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-175823" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2022/08/touch-keyboard-new-settings-1024x691.png" alt="New touch keyboard settings." width="1024" height="691" /></a> New touch keyboard settings.[/caption]

<em>[We are beginning to roll this out, so the experience isn’t available to all Insiders just yet as we plan to monitor feedback and see how it lands before pushing it out to everyone.]</em>

<strong>FEEDBACK: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Input and Language &gt; Touch keyboard.</strong>
<h2><strong>Changes and Improvements</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>[Windows Terminal]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Windows Terminal is now the default terminal in Windows 11. This means, all command line applications will open in Windows Terminal automatically (Command Prompt and PowerShell, for example). The setting for this change can be found via <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; security &gt; For developers</strong>. Please note that Windows Terminal <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-preview-1-15-release/">version 1.15</a> or greater is required for this feature.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Settings]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Updated the Wi-Fi and VPN properties pages in Settings to now include a link to advanced properties for that network.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Fixes</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>[Taskbar] </strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed an issue related to the taskbar overflow which was impacting explorer.exe reliability.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Start]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed an issue that was causing Start's recommended to only show one column instead of two.</li>
 	<li>Made a fix for Narrator mistakenly reading out the search box in Start twice.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where the access keys (underlined letters) in WIN + X had duplicate definitions when an update was pending reboot.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[File Explorer]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed an issue causing a small percentage of Insiders to experience repeated explorer.exe crashes after attempting to access certain folders on their systems in the last couple Dev Channel builds.</li>
 	<li>Fixed a recent issue where if File Explorer was open when you switched between light and dark mode, you could end up with some unreadable text / UI showing the wrong color.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue that was causing explorer.exe to crash when opening folders with certain images.</li>
 	<li>The up arrow should no longer be misaligned in File Explorer.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue which could lead to not being able to unpin Desktop, Pictures, or Documents folders from Quick access.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an underlying explorer.exe crash which could happen when File Explorer launch was aborted, for example if you were attempting to access a network share from the Run dialog, were prompted for credentials, and then clicked cancel instead of entering them.</li>
 	<li>If the tab title is too long to display completely in the available space, hovering your mouse over it will now show a tooltip with the full name.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue which could lead to explorer.exe crashing when File Explorer was closed.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue causing the delete key to unexpectedly not work on files in File Explorer sometimes.</li>
 	<li>Removed the toolbar some people were unexpectedly seeing (with View / Edit / etc) after the introduction of tabs in File Explorer. As part of this, the “always show menus” option in Folder Options was also removed which didn’t do anything.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Search]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed an underlying crash which could lead to search not launching.</li>
 	<li>Searching for “detect displays” will now return Display Settings.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Input] </strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Made a number of updates to emoji keywords based on feedback, including fixing that searching for apple didn’t return the red apple emoji in Korean or Polish (in the respective languages), searching for trash or garbage in English should now return the wastebasket emoji, searching for roger in English should now return the saluting face emoji, and searching for bug will now return the ladybug emoji. Please continue sharing feedback about emoji search results under Input &amp; Language &gt; Emoji Panel in the Feedback Hub!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Settings]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where in certain cases removing a printer from Settings wouldn’t work.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where the DNS suffix search list entry wasn’t displaying correctly in Settings.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where the buttons for changing current view in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Installed apps might unexpectedly show arrows overlaid on top.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Task Manager]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Updated the positioning of the View button tooltip position so it shouldn’t block the close button in the title bar anymore.</li>
 	<li>The arrow shown when sorting processes by CPU should no longer be black on black in certain cases when using dark mode.</li>
 	<li>Updated the selection highlight color when you select rows on the Details or Services page to be less bright and more aligned with the other colors used with the updated Task Manager design.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Other]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed an issue leading to missing / broken characters on the Bitlocker screen when using the Japanese display language.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where the Advanced Settings of an application pool on a remote IIS server would display a blank screen.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where Steps Recorder wouldn’t close when you pressed ALT + F4.</li>
</ul>
<em>NOTE: Some fixes noted here in Insider Preview builds from the Dev Channel may make their way into the servicing updates for the released version of Windows 11.</em>
<h2><strong>Known issues</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>[General]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Some games that use Easy Anti-Cheat may crash or cause your PC to bugcheck.</li>
 	<li>We’re looking into reports that audio stopped working for some Insiders after upgrading to the last flight.</li>
 	<li>We’re investigating reports of a few different apps having started crashing in recent builds.</li>
 	<li>[<strong>NEW</strong>] Enabling .NET Framework 3.5 from the Windows Features dialog will not work in this build. If you had it enabled prior to upgrading, it may become disabled. This will potentially lead to issues with apps that rely on these components. We’re working on a fix.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[File Explorer]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>We’re working on the fix for an issue where the search box background in File Explorer might be the opposite color of your current mode.</li>
 	<li>We’re working on the fix for an issue where the taskbar isn’t able to display if File Explorer is maximized and you have the taskbar set to auto-hide.</li>
 	<li>[<strong>NEW</strong>] A fix for File Explorer appearing to open and close before finally finishing drawing when launched from certain locations will be available in a future flight.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Widgets]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Notification badge number may appear misaligned on the taskbar.</li>
 	<li>In some cases, the notification banner for some badging will not appear in the widgets board.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Printing]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>We’re working on the fix for an issue in recent Dev Channel flights causing lines to not be included when printing tables from certain apps.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>For developers</strong></h2>
You can download the latest Windows Insider SDK at <a href="https://aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk">aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk</a>.

SDK NuGet packages are now also flighting at <a href="https://www.nuget.org/profiles/WindowsSDK">NuGet Gallery | WindowsSDK</a> which include:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref/">.NET TFM packages</a> for use in .NET apps as described at <a href="https://aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk">ms/windowsinsidersdk</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.CPP/">C++ packages</a> for Win32 headers and libs per architecture</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools/">BuildTools package</a> when you just need tools like MakeAppx.exe, MakePri.exe, and SignTool.exe</li>
</ul>
These NuGet packages provide more granular access to the SDK and better integrate in CI/CD pipelines.
<h2><strong>Microsoft Store Update</strong></h2>
We are beginning to test <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/05/24/microsoft-store-grows-with-the-developer-community/">Microsoft Store Ads</a> in search results. Developers interested in participating can sign up on the waitlist <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.office.com%2FPages%2FResponsePage.aspx%3Fid%3Dv4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0qhf-gSatdCgmqCvPskx_NUQktMM1lQSU5UOUVQWDdIRUhDUjc4UDlOSS4u&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cnmallikarjun%40microsoft.com%7C30254a5dd0a747e534b708da8565eec1%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637968970123537245%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2Blc9QKok0C55HCOWCKcTiuetHyNPlu0rkRxoW9mjj5o%3D&amp;reserved=0">here</a>.
<h2><strong>About the Dev Channel</strong></h2>
The Dev Channel receives builds that represent long lead work from our engineers <strong>with features and experiences that may never get released</strong> as we try out different concepts and get feedback. It is important to remember that the builds we release to the Dev Channel should not be seen as matched to any specific release of Windows and the features included may change over time, be removed, or replaced in Insider builds or may never be released beyond Windows Insiders to general customers. For more information, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/02/03/whats-coming-for-the-windows-insider-program-in-2022/">please read this blog post</a> about how we plan to use the Dev Channel to incubate new ideas, work on long lead items, and control the states of individual features.

These aren’t always stable builds, and sometimes you will see issues that block key activities or require workarounds. <strong>It is important to make sure you read the known issues listed in our blog posts as we document many of these issues with each flight.</strong>

Build numbers are higher in the Dev Channel than the Windows 11 preview builds in the Beta and Release Preview Channels. You will not be able to switch from the Dev Channel to the Beta or Release Preview Channels without doing a clean install back to the released version of Windows 11 currently.

ALSO: Because the Dev and Beta Channels represent parallel development paths from our engineers, there may be cases where features and experiences show up in the Beta Channel first.

<strong>The desktop watermark you see at the lower right corner of your desktop is normal for these pre-release builds.</strong>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello Windows Insiders, today we are releasing <strong>Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22621.586 and Build 22622.586 (KB5016701) </strong>to the Beta Channel.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Build 2262<em>2</em>.586</strong> = New features rolling out.</li>
 	<li><strong>Build 22621.586</strong> = New features off by default.</li>
</ul>
As a reminder, Insiders who landed in the group with new features turned off by default (Build 22621.xxxx) can check for updates and choose to install the update that will have features rolling out (Build 22622.xxx).
<h2><strong>Fixes in Build 22622.586</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>[General]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>We fixed an issue causing DWM crashes (leading to black flashes or content stuck on the screen) for Insiders on 22622.575.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue causing SQL Server Management Studio to fail to launch for some Insiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[File Explorer]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed an issue causing the left-half of the File Explorer title bar to not be draggable via mouse or touch for some Insiders.</li>
 	<li>Selecting multiple folders and then using the context menu option to open them in a new tab will now actually do that, rather than opening the first folder in a new tab and all the others in a new window.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue causing Home, Documents, Pictures, and potentially other folders to become unexpectedly duplicated in File Explorer’s navigation pane or appear on the desktop.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an explorer.exe crash which could happen when closing a newly opened File Explorer window.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue where the search box background in File Explorer might be the opposite color of your current mode (for example dark in light mode).</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where File Explorer would appear to open, close, and re-open before it finished drawing after being launched from certain places (for example when opening the location of a downloaded file from Microsoft Edge).</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue which could lead to explorer.exe crashing when File Explorer was closed.</li>
 	<li>The up arrow should no longer be misaligned in File Explorer.</li>
 	<li>Removed the toolbar some people were unexpectedly seeing (with View / Edit / etc.) after the introduction of tabs in File Explorer. As part of this, the “always show menus” option in Folder Options was also removed which didn’t do anything.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an underlying explorer.exe crash which could happen when File Explorer launch was aborted, for example if you were attempting to access a network share from the Run dialog, were prompted for credentials, and then clicked cancel instead of entering them.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue causing the delete key to unexpectedly not work on files in File Explorer sometimes.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue which could lead to not being able to unpin Desktop, Pictures, or Documents folders from Quick access.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue when dragging and dropping a folder to pin it to the navigation pane, that the line indicating where it would be inserted didn’t have enough contrast in dark mode.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where the min / max / close button might not be visible in File Explorer when using a contrast theme.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Taskbar]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed an issue which could lead to the taskbar overflow flyout unexpectedly appearing on the opposite side of the screen.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where the taskbar overflow flyout might appear floating away from the taskbar if you opened it after a display scaling change.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where if you right clicked an app in the taskbar and selected Close all windows, it wasn’t bringing the app into the foreground anymore if it needed attention before closing (for example, if you hadn’t saved the contents of a Notepad window).</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where explorer.exe might crash if you attempted to rearrange app icons on the taskbar while the taskbar overflow was open.</li>
 	<li>Fixed an issue for Insiders with at least two monitors, where if the monitors had different DPI, the taskbar overflow could appear before it was needed or end up overlapped with the date and time on the secondary monitor.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Settings]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed a Settings crash that could happen when uninstalling certain apps.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue where the buttons for changing current view in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Installed apps might unexpectedly show arrows overlaid on top.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Suggested Actions]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed an issue where when Suggested Actions was enabled, if you copied multiple items in a row to your clipboard history, some of the items might not display after you pressed WIN + V.</li>
 	<li>Your preferred state for the Suggested Actions setting under System &gt; Clipboard should persist upgrade going forward from this build.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Fixes for BOTH Build 22621.586 &amp; Build 22622.586</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>We fixed an issue where some Lenovo devices were not receiving updates as expected.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue causing domain credentials to not work for some Insiders on the previous Beta Channel flight.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue where the “Sync across your devices” option under Settings &gt; System &gt; Clipboard wouldn’t stay enabled.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue that affects Microsoft Defender Application Guard (MDAG). It delays or stops MDAG from opening.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue that affects URLs generated by JavaScript: URLs. These URLs do not work as expected when you add them to the Favorites menu in IE mode.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue that forces the IE mode tabs in a session to reload.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue that affects <strong>open</strong> in IE mode.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue that successfully opens a browser window in IE mode to display a PDF file. Later, browsing to another IE mode site within the same window fails. 40411607</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue that might bypass MSHTML and ActiveX rules for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC).</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue that affects the SharedPC account manager. The issue stops it from deleting many accounts during cleanup.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue that affects a network’s static IP. The issue causes the configuration of the static IP to be inconsistent. Because of this, <strong>NetworkAdapterConfiguration() </strong>fails sporadically.</li>
 	<li>We fixed an issue that affects the <strong>FindNextFileNameW()</strong> It might leak memory.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Known issues</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>[General]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>We’re looking into reports that audio stopped working for some Insiders in recent Beta Channel builds.</li>
 	<li>[<strong>NEW</strong>] A small percent of Insiders may experience repeated explorer.exe crashes on this build after attempting to access certain folders on your system. Insiders who have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/gdk/_content/gc/getstarted/devkit-contents">the Xbox Dev Kit</a> installed will hit this. We’re working on a fix for this in a future flight.</li>
 	<li><strong>[ADDED]</strong> Control Panel will not launch from the Start menu, Search or if pinned to the taskbar. As a workaround, use WIN + X, choose "Run" and type Control Panel to launch Control Panel.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[File Explorer]</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>We’re working on the fix for an issue where the taskbar isn’t able to display if File Explorer is maximized and you have the taskbar set to auto-hide.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>About the Beta Channel</strong></h2>
The Beta Channel will be the place we preview experiences that are closer to what we will ship to our general customers. Because the Dev and Beta Channels represent parallel development paths from our engineers, there may be cases where features and experiences show up in the Beta Channel first. However, this does not mean every feature we try out in the Beta Channel will ship. We encourage Insiders to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/02/03/whats-coming-for-the-windows-insider-program-in-2022/">read this blog post</a> that outlines the ways we’ll try things out with Insiders in both the Dev and Beta Channels.

We are excited to take this first step on our path to make this preview available in other countries and regions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this year, CORSAIR – known for its high-performance gear and systems for gamers, content creators and PC enthusiasts – introduced its first gaming and streaming laptop, the <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/voyager-a1600-gaming-streaming-pc-laptop">CORSAIR VOYAGER a1600 AMD Advantage Edition</a>.

On Aug. 18, the company <a href="https://live.corsair.com/?_ga=2.260023498.1788416592.1660841983-623453940.1660841983">livestreamed</a> an event highlighting this powerful and versatile PC. (On the livestream page, move the slider at the bottom of the video to the 30 minute mark to view the event.)

Whether you’re an aspiring content creator, avid gamer, or a full-time streamer, this laptop can do everything you need and more, thanks to an AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processor and AMD Radeon RX 6800M mobile graphics. An advanced compact vapor chamber cooling system evenly spreads the heat.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-177549 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2022/08/CORSAIR_VOYAGER_22-1024x683.jpg" alt="Man sitting at a desk working on a laptop, wearing over-ear heaphones" width="1024" height="683" />

When you’re <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-pc-gaming">gaming on a Windows 11 PC</a> like this, you can see the difference in features such as DirectX12 Ultimate, which delivers immersive gaming experiences, with enhancements that improve latency and performance [1]. And if you’re looking for your next favorite game(s), you can try and play over a hundred of them with PC Game Pass. Get to it through the Xbox app for Windows PC. An EA Play membership is included at no additional cost and gives you more from the games you love [2].

16-inch 2560×1600 QHD+ IPS screen, which includes an ultra-high 240Hz refresh rate and support for AMD FreeSync Premium technology.

Incorporating technology from the content creation experts at Elgato, the <a href="https://www.corsair.com/newsroom/press-release/game-create-anywhere-introducing-the-corsair-voyager-a1600-gaming-streaming-laptop-amd-advantage-edition">CORSAIR VOYAGER a1600</a> is a laptop built specifically with streamers in mind. Above the keyboard are 10 easy-access customizable S-key shortcut buttons, putting one-touch control at your fingertips.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Set sail for the Sea of the Damned to confront the Dark Brethren in "A Hunter's Cry," <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P2N57MC619K">Sea of Thieves</a>' sixth time-limited Adventure that is live now until 9 a.m. UTC on Sept. 1.

"Murderous conspiracies, covert rituals, unwisely buried instructions..." writes Chris "Brawler" Allcock on SeaOfThievies.com. "Having been absent from Sea of Thieves’ ongoing story for a while, the Dark Brethren’s return to the waves brought about plenty of fresh revelations and set pirates’ tongues wagging in the wake of our (and Merrick’s) previous Adventure, 'The Forsaken Hunter.'"
